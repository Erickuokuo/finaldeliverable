# final deliverable
Does the system work? I.e., does it read in the data and present an interactive visualization of the data? Is it usable and comprehensible? Does it not crash?
Is the visualization an effective representation of the data? Is it clear and useful, and does it effectively communicate different aspects of the data
Does the visualization support different analytical questions and/or communicative objectives about the data? These objectives should be made clear in the description.pdf file you submit.
Does the visualization effectively apply the ideas we learned all semester? Does it follow good visualization design principles?
Does the visualization exhibit some creativity? While we are not expecting totally innovative new representations, we are looking for visualizations that show novelty compared to existing visualizations that you’ve created for this course. Go beyond simple scatterplots or bar charts. “Going beyond” here could mean in terms of the presentation method (e.g., storytelling), interaction (e.g., powerful multi-attribute filtering/dynamic querying), or visual representation (e.g., a creative new way to map data values to visual glyphs).
